# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A GAN is a type of **generative model** used for learning a data distribution and then sampling data from the learned distribution. The **generator** does this work whereas a different component - the **discriminator** - checks whether the data generated comes from the actual data distribution or has been generated by the generator. That is, it checks whether the input is **REAL or FAKE**. Hence, GANs can be used for generating images very similar to real-life images. The link to the original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).

This repository contains my implementation of the original GAN paper. I've used the **MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron)** as used by the authors of the paper to map a 100 dimensional latent variable space(noise) to an image which is then fed into the discriminator which is also a MLP. It was trained on the inbuilt **MNIST dataset** of digits. Obviously, using **Convolutional Neural Networks** (as in DCGAN) in place of Multi-Layer Perceptron can help in increasing the accuracy of the model though MLPs have also give quite satisfactory results. The hyperparameter k was set equal to 1 as was done by the authors, as it was the least computationally expensive option. TF-GANs can also be used for getting highly efficient implementations.

These are some results from the training process, in which I trained the model for **80000 epochs** with **32 examples** in each epoch and sampled images from the generator at intervals of 200 epochs.
